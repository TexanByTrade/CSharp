# Large Walsh-Hadamard Transform

This is an application of the WHT algorithm found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01039, by Yi Lu. When performing the WHT on matrices far too large to fit in memory, a special algorithm has to be used to load pieces of the matrix in batches and then re-write the results.
